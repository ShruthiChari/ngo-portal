Seva Project
============

The goal is to create a website for the iCare group to help out NGOs and volunteering students. This is a very basic site forked from Pinax (which is based on Django). 

Conmpleted:
1) Student registration form

Todo:
Please check the spec_sheet.docx for more information. It is still very vague, improving it with specific details would be the goal. If possible, convert it to plaintext (markdown?).
There are few wireframes in the wireframes/ folder.


Setup:
pip install -r requirements.txt

After your edits
./start.sh
This is tiny bash script to syncdb and runserver

Please checkout the references for specifics:
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/
Check out the requirements.txt
Googling should take you to their corresponding documentation like
http://django-user-accounts.readthedocs.org/en/latest/usage.html

Pretty much everything is a Google away. If you are stuck feel free to mail me.
